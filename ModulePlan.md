# Module #5 Plan | CSE 310 
Choose Your Own Adventure
### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your
selected module during this Sprint. Include details such as what
(task), when (time), where (location), and duration. You should
also include time to work on your team project. You are expected
to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module,
team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual
module should be at least 10 hours.

NOTE: Because I am behind on this module, I will be planning this as a checklist 
split into 1h chunks. I can know I am on-pace as I am moving on to different parts
of the project each hour and this will help me stay focused on what I need to do
next. 
|Task|Time to complete|Completed?|

|Install/Setup|1h|X|
|Study basics and Experiment|2h| |
|Follow a Tutorial|1h| |
